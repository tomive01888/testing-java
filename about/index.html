        <h3 class="text1">About MMF</h3>
        <p class="paragraph1">
          MMF is a music school in Antsirabe, Madagascar, that works holistically to help street children out of
          poverty. MMF was founded by Eline Rodvelt Hansen and her husband Dina Risalina Andriamanalina in 2021.
          Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with one in two children malnourished and only one in
          three completing primary school. Our target group is the poorest children in Antsirabe, as well as children
          who fall outside the scope of other aid organizations.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph2">
          The children we take in as students at MMF are living on the streets when we get to know them. The reason they
          live on the streets is poverty. When families do not have food to give to their children, sending them out to
          beg becomes the only means of survival. The children are left to fend for themselves, and it is often seen
          that older children take responsibility for their younger siblings. The daily life of children living on the
          street is extremely tough and difficult to imagine. During the day, they spend a lot of time and effort
          begging and looking for food in the trash. As darkness approaches, it is important to find a safe place to
          sleep for the night.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph3">
          At MMF, we work to find safe caregivers who can take care of each child. Ideally, we want them to be with
          their mother and father, but in some cases, this is difficult to achieve. So far, there is always a
          grandmother or an aunt who both wants and is able to take care of the children with extra support and help
          from us. Instead of taking responsibility away from the parents by caring for the children ourselves, we work
          to strengthen each family and help the parents take care of their children. When we take in a new child into
          the project, we usually include all the siblings. We have found that working together with the whole family
          gives good results, and we feel it would be unfair if a sibling does not get the same opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph4">
          We currently have a total of 70 children at MMF aged 1-19 years. The children sleep at home but are with us in
          our facilities all day when they are not at school. Here, they receive help with schoolwork, meals, follow-up
          from our doctor on health and nutrition, music lessons, and plenty of time for play and activities together.
          We actively work to help the children develop, and for us, it is important that the assistance we provide
          ultimately strengthens the children to stand on their own feet as they grow older.
