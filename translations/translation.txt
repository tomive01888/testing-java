For this to work you need to add "data-translate" and connect each element 
you want to translate with this tag.

Here is a footer example:

<div class="link-container">
    <div class="footer-links">
        <a href="#" data-translate="home">Home</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="aboutUs">About Us</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="services">Services</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="contact">Contact</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="blog">Blog</a>
    </div>
    <div class="footer-extra-links">
        <a href="#" data-translate="faq">FAQ</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="terms">Terms of Service</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
        <a href="#" data-translate="careers">Careers</a>
    </div>
</div>

Each has their own "data-translate" tag with a string value name related to it's value.
Naming them must give meaning and not confusing name-tags. Especially when you have
multiple or similar links, urls, buttons or options that share similarities.

What matters is that when the client creates a new blog, and if this blog comes on the 
webpage with a button called "Read more". This button needs to get this "data-translate"
tag or otherwise it won't be updated to the correct language upon switching. If this is 
doable or not, I have no clue. As the CMS has not been a thing I learned during our 
time on this project


As the page grows, and buttons and urls gets added, so does this list.
Essentially needing maintaining from a developer. If the "data-translate" is something
that can be added from CMS so it's pre-added before content gets made, then is perfect.

Without knowing how to structure of each .html will be and what's gonna be hardcoded or not.
Moving forward with this can be tricky. But here I am assuming we will do a basic structure
for the english (default) .html and when going into Norwegian or Malagasy, file structure is
then redirected inside a folder "/no/index.html" (www.mmf.madagascar.com/no/) for norwegian 
and malagasy "/mg/index.html" (www.mmf.madagascar.com/mg/). And inside each folder it
follows the same file structure as the default with, more named folders index.html files.
